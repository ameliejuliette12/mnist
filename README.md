# MNIST - Generating a Digit Recognizer using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Machine Learning Final Coursework project which focuses on developing a digit recognition system through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project employs the well-known MNIST dataset, comprising 70,000 handwritten digit images. By training the ANN, the project aims to automate image classification tasks, contributing to various fields including medical diagnosis and manufacturing.

Objectives:
1. Showcase the potential of deep learning for image classification.
2. Compare different deep learning models and architectures.
3. Establish a benchmark for new machine learning techniques using MNIST.
4. Facilitate the development of image classification algorithms.
5. Support educational endeavors in deep learning and image classification.
6. Investigate hyperparameter impact on model performance.

Analysis and Conclusion:
Upon evaluation, the model yields impressive results with a prediction error of 1.79%, demonstrating its accuracy. Two models were developed, each excelling under distinct evaluation protocols. The hold-out validation model achieved 95.88% accuracy, while iterated k-fold validation exhibited a prediction error of 1.79%. This signifies the potential of both models, with the iterated k-fold model slightly outperforming the hold-out model due to its lower prediction error. In conclusion, the project effectively creates accurate digit recognition models and successfully achieves its set objectives.
